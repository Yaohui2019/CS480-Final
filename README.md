Most of my code were taken from these two Kaggle Notebooks:

**To reproduce the result which I got for my Kaggle competition:**    
-Get the embedding from "DNO_Embedding.ipnyb" and Run "Kaggle_Model.ipnyb"    


**To reproduce the result of my proposed model (Which wasn't my best prediction):**    
-Get DINO Embedding from "DNO_embedding.ipnyb"    
-Run "ViT.ipynb" to train the ViTMLP    
-Get VitMLP features from "ViTMLP_embedding.ipynb"    
-Run "Report_model.ipynb"    

:( Such a rigurous approach but just to see it to overfit    

Please make sure the addresses for the files are correct for the embeddings
